This handicap is frequently associated with ecologically specialised taxa due to environmental constraints through stabilizing selection. Supratidal rockpools are very dynamic environments with dramatic changes in water level as a result of cycles of rain and desiccation, which affect water availability and their physicochemical characteristics (e.g., salinity or temperature) and lead to a very specialised fauna. Here, we study the genetic diversity and phylogeographic patterns of supratidal rockpool Ochthebius (Coleoptera: Hydraenidae) in the Iberian Peninsula. We used both mitochondrial and nuclear DNA to highlight the presence of morphologically cryptic lineages, suggesting plausible dispersal barriers that help us understand their genetic isolation, fuelled by historical and contemporary marine hydrogeography. Past geological events (i.e., Messinian Salinity Crisis) matched the topological splits between lineages, whilst current wind and coastal oceanic currents determine the phylogeographical structure of Ochthebius lineages. This study shows that oceanic processes are also key to understand the evolutionary dynamics on the supratidal habitats. Moreover, we set the basis for deeper analysis of rockpool Ochthebius but further studies are needed for decision-making on whether these genetic lineages should represent novel species.","tags":[],"title":"Crypticity within supratidal rockpools","type":"talk"},{"authors":["Langille B","Tierney SM","Bertozzi T","Beasley-Hall PG","Bradford TM","Fagan-Jeffries EP","Hyde J","Leijs R","Richardson M","Saint KM","Stringer DN","Villastrigo A","Humphreys WF","Austin AD","Cooper SJB"],"categories":["JCR journal"],"content":"","date":1659346470,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1659346470,"objectID":"b912cce8824450b4e2c78ed0f8394f14","permalink":"/publication/parallel-decay-of-vision-genes/","publishdate":"2022-08-01T11:34:30+02:00","relpermalink":"/publication/parallel-decay-of-vision-genes/","section":"publication","summary":"In the framework of neutral theory of molecular evolution, genes specific to the development and function of eyes in subterranean animals living in permanent darkness are expected to evolve by relaxed selection, ultimately becoming pseudogenes. However, definitive empirical evidence for the role of neutral processes in the loss of vision over evolutionary time remains controversial. In previous studies, we characterized an assemblage of independently-evolved water beetle (Dytiscidae) species from a subterranean archipelago in Western Australia, where parallel vision and eye loss have occurred. Using a combination of transcriptomics and exon capture, we present evidence of parallel coding sequence decay, resulting from the accumulation of frameshift mutations and premature stop codons, in eight phototransduction genes (arrestins, opsins, ninaC and transient receptor potential channel genes) in 32 subterranean species in contrast to surface species, where these genes have open reading frames. Our results provide strong evidence to support neutral evolutionary processes as a major contributing factor to the loss of phototransduction genes in subterranean animals, with the ultimate fate being the irreversible loss of a light detection system.","tags":["Regressive evolution","Pseudogenisation","Neutral evolution theory","Dytiscidae","Subterranean beetles","Vision genes"],"title":"Parallel decay of vision genes in subterranean water beetles","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Villastrigo A","Humphreys WF","Cooper SJB","Balke M"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1655805511,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1655805511,"objectID":"1f645f19913f9381978489d78085cdee","permalink":"/talk/evolution-2022/","publishdate":"2022-06-21T11:58:31+02:00","relpermalink":"/talk/evolution-2022/","section":"talk","summary":"Altitudinal gradients are compelling by their steady change that may confine species to narrow conditions, leading species to habitat specialization and thus, a distinct fauna from their surrounding habitats. It is considered that most alpine lineages originated through dispersion from lowlands or from other mountain ranges, but this does not take into account the evolutionary trajectories of the pre-existing species before the orogeny (i.e., the feasible passive uplifting of local species). Notably, long-term uplifting rates for young orogenic belts can reach 1 mm per year, which implies that local taxa may be uplifting 1000 metres in just one million years. Considering the New Guinea orogen, tropical lowlands were uplifted to an altitude of nearly 5000 metres in the past 8 million years, creating a vast tropical alpine and upper montane habitat surrounded by wet tropical climate. At the opposite end of the elevational gradient, there are also some species adapted to living permanently underground. Colonization of subterranean habitats generally occurs by preadapted local species, but two hypotheses consider different scenarios: i) species are ‘forced’ to live outside surface habitats due to unsuitable surface environmental conditions (Climatic Relict Hypothesis (CRH)) and ii) species may access actively these habitats, where eventually they get confined (Adaptive Shift Hypothesis). Despite a large number of organisms able to survive in a wide altitudinal spectrum, it is rare to find lineages with representatives that inhabit both alpine and subterranean habitats. One remarkable example is the diving beetle genus Limbodessus, which includes representatives from groundwaters in Australia to, at least, 4200 metres elevation in the alpine region of New Guinea. Subsequently, species have developed extreme morphological traits related to cuticle, vision and wing development that enhance their fitness in these opposite habitats. To investigate how Limbodessus thrived in such contrasting habitats and understand the tempo and mode of evolution of their morphological traits, we carried out low-coverage whole-genome sequencing from museum specimens to extract mitochondrial genomes plus heritage markers, in combination with ultraconserved elements. Our preliminary results are compatible with multiple independent colonization of groundwater habitats consistent with the CRH (i.e., the ongoing aridification of Australia from the Middle to Late Miocene), but single colonization of alpine habitats about 10 Ma. The origin of alpine species coincides with substantial landmass formation in New Guinea, and posterior diversification events during the last 4 Ma in a scenario compatible with the passive uplifting hypothesis.","tags":[],"title":"Colonization of opposite ends of an extreme altitudinal gradient","type":"talk"},{"authors":["Villastrigo A","Bilton DT","Abellán P","Millán A","Ribera I","Velasco J"],"categories":["JCR journal"],"content":"","date":1652348043,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1652348043,"objectID":"ab6f9959d4c726427f72c5c2fbddd086","permalink":"/publication/cryptic-lineages-cryptic-barriers/","publishdate":"2022-05-12T11:34:03+02:00","relpermalink":"/publication/cryptic-lineages-cryptic-barriers/","section":"publication","summary":"Morphologically cryptic lineages confound many estimates of global biodiversity and are often discovered in ecologically specialized taxa, subject to strong morphological constraint.

Here we explore the genetic diversity and phylogeography of supralittoral rockpool Ochthebius beetles in the eastern Atlantic and western Mediterranean, using a combination of mitochondrial and nuclear markers and dense geographical sampling of the three recognized widespread species. Our results point to the existence of morphologically cryptic lineages within all currently named taxa and suggest that the distribution of these is linked to both historical and contemporary marine hydrogeography; a combination of ocean currents and winds apparently driving the spatial patterns observed. The main contemporary barrier to dispersal for Ochthebius is located around the Ibiza Channel, whilst the Messinian Salinity Crisis appears to have been the ultimate driver of lineage diversification in these insects. Our results show that oceanographic processes do not just shape the evolution of fully marine species, but also impact significantly on the terrestrially derived inhabitants of the coastal zone.","tags":["cryptic species","dispersal","Mediterranean rocky shores","Ochthebius","beetles","phylogeography"],"title":"Cryptic lineages, cryptic barriers: Historical seascapes and oceanic fronts drive genetic diversity in supralittoral rockpool beetles (Coleoptera: Hydraenidae)","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Balke M","Bilton DT","García M","Viloria AL","Villastrigo A","Hendrich L"],"categories":["JCR journal"],"content":"","date":1652175224,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1652175224,"objectID":"2b49ce393296e4e9ede0e0caa46c7d21","permalink":"/publication/two-new-andean-species/","publishdate":"2022-05-10T11:33:44+02:00","relpermalink":"/publication/two-new-andean-species/","section":"publication","summary":"Two new species of the diving beetle genus Liodessus Guignot, 1939 are described from high mountain regions in Venezuela: Liodessus meridensis sp. nov. from Laguna de Mucabají, Mérida and L. venezuelensis sp. nov. from Laguna de Mucabají and below Pico Bolívar, Mérida.

Both habitat types present differences based on their physical and chemical characteristics, leading to different ecological dynamics at geological scale, in essentially long-term habitat stability. Small standing water environments, where aquatic beetles are usually found, are usually filled up by sediments in decades, whilst running water environments are stable and they are connected with the drainage network, even when they sometimes dry up seasonally. Some studies had shown that one of the consequences of living in one kind or the other is a difference in range size linked to their dispersal capabilities, with standing water species having broader geographical ranges than running water species. It has been hypothesizing that dispersal abilities may affect gene flow and turnover, but there is a lack of knowledge of how these differences affect long-term diversification.\nHydroporini is a speciose tribe containing ca. 680 species living in both habitats, making them and ideal group to study diversification. We built a phylogeny of Hydroporini combining 5 genes obtained with sanger sequences plus 69 mitochondrial genomes. In total, 473 terminals representing species were used. Ecological data were obtained by bibliographic revision plus own collected information in the field. Phylogeny and habitat type evolution were reconstructed using Bayesian inference. Diversification rates were calculated using Bayesian Analysis of Macroevolutionary Mixtures (BAMM) and method of moments (MM). Preliminary results suggest that the most recent common ancestor of Hydroporini was reconstructed with a preference for running water, with multiple shifts to standing waters. We also found several significant diversification shifts across the phylogeny, and a clear pattern of gradual accelerated speciation.","tags":[],"title":"Untangling extant biodiversity in Hydroporini","type":"talk"},{"authors":["Villastrigo A","Jäch MA","Cardoso A","Valladares LF","Ribera I"],"categories":["JCR journal"],"content":"","date":1546867497,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1546867497,"objectID":"2a4952878aeacb7d46723c91e5f2ba06","permalink":"/publication/a-molecular-phylogeny-of-the-tribe-ochthebiini/","publishdate":"2020-06-07T15:24:57+02:00","relpermalink":"/publication/a-molecular-phylogeny-of-the-tribe-ochthebiini/","section":"publication","summary":"Ochthebiinae, with c. 650 species distributed worldwide, are the second most speciose subfamily of the aquatic beetle family Hydraenidae.

One of the most remarkable traits in primarily freshwater organisms is the possibility to tolerate saline or hypersaline habitats. Recent work in some water beetle families (Hydrophilidae and Dytiscidae) has led to the hypothesis that tolerance to salinity is an exaptation to drought resistance. However, whereas in Hydrophilidae there are fast and direct transitions from freshwater to hypersaline water, as expected under an exaptation scenario, in the studied Dytiscidae all transitions were gradual, from freshwater to saline and then hypersaline waters. In this work we study the third of the main lineages of water beetles with species in saline habitats, the genus Ochthebius (Hydraenidae). We build a comprehensive phylogeny of Ochthebius, with approximately 50% of the ca. 550 known species and a combination of three mitochondrial and two nuclear genes. Despite the general good support of most clades relationships among basal clades was still unresolved, so we obtained mitochondrial genomes of ca. 20 species with a mitochondrial metagenomics protocol with the aim to anchor some of the unsupported nodes in the tree. We compiled ecological data on the habitat of all species to reconstruct the tempo and mode of tolerance to salinity using Bayesian methods.","tags":[],"title":"Ochthebiini: a mitogenome approach to tempo and mode of salinity tolerance evolution","type":"talk"},{"authors":["Villastrigo A"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1533131809,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1533131809,"objectID":"44d547f5a18bcc76e9c2f003fa2164bb","permalink":"/talk/australia-2018/","publishdate":"2020-06-07T15:56:49+02:00","relpermalink":"/talk/australia-2018/","section":"talk","summary":"","tags":[],"title":"From deserts to tropical forest - Short Stay","type":"talk"},{"authors":["Villastrigo A","Andújar C","Arribas P","Ribera I"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1516111007,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1516111007,"objectID":"84422960a6195cbb5dabf9e573389ea9","permalink":"/talk/cisa-iv-2018/","publishdate":"2020-06-07T15:56:47+02:00","relpermalink":"/talk/cisa-iv-2018/","section":"talk","summary":"Phylogenetic trees are not always recovered with enough support to test particular hypothesis.

These traits may influence the origin and diversification of new lineages, and some of them may also facilitate the transition between different habitat types. Focusing on the aquatic environment, some of the most important transitions occurred between lotic and lentic environments, and between ecosystems with different salinities. With reference to the first transition, it has been established that species living in standing water (less persistent than running waters at geological time scales) need greater dispersion capability than running water species. On the second transition, some authors have shown that salinity tolerance may appear in independent lineages during arid periods, likely as a byproduct of increased resistance to desiccation. We use different groups of aquatic Coleoptera as evolutionary models: the genus Ochthebius (Hydraenidae), and tribes Hydroporini (Dytiscidae) and Hygrotini sensu lato (Dytiscidae). It is expected that transitions between habitat types had some effect on the diversification pattern on the lineages. We have tested these predictions with Hygrotini sensu stricto, including 129 specimens from 53 species with a Holartic and Afrotropical distribution. Five gene fragments were used in the phylogenetic analysis (COI, 16S, 18S, H3 and 28S). We used molecular phylogenies, ecological data and physiologic experiments to reconstruct macroevolutionary patterns of the traits using bayesian methods. Our results show a clear preference for lentic environments in Hygrotini, which are ancestral to the lineage, with repeated independent emergence of isolated lotic species. Similarly, high salinity tolerance has emerged independently in several lineages from an ancestor with slightly saline tolerance. Preliminary analyses suggest that the transitions to higher saline tolerance occurred predominantly in geological periods with increased aridity, supporting the hypothesis that salinity tolerance in water beetles could be an exaptation of tolerance to desiccation.","tags":[],"title":"Macroevolutionary consequences of habitat transitions in aquatic Coleoptera","type":"talk"},{"authors":["Villastrigo A"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1445522190,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1445522190,"objectID":"6a31e8ecc4c638c006ed67248e65dca5","permalink":"/talk/murcia-seminar-2015/","publishdate":"2020-06-07T15:56:30+02:00","relpermalink":"/talk/murcia-seminar-2015/","section":"talk","summary":"","tags":[],"title":"Efectos ecológicos de la sequía sobre la comunidad de macroinvertebrados bentónicos en ecosistemas lacustres.
